A list is a collection of things with multiple types.
An array, conventionally, is known to only have one array type for the whole.

You access things in collection via their index.
Collections always work n - 1. They are one-offs.
To access the first element do so by `someArray[0]`

```py
# While Loop
# while (someVariableOrThing < someMax):
#     doAThing()
#     someVariableOrThing = someVariableOrThing + 1

# For Loop
# for eachElement in someList:
#     # the first time: eachElement == someList[0]
#     # the second Time: eachElement == someList[1]
#     doAThing()
```

```py
# traditional for loop
# someCondition = 5
# for (int x = 0; x < someCondition; x++):
#     print(x)
#     # Here is where the postfix would happen

# for (<prefix>; <evaluation>; <post-fix>)
#     doAThing()
```

When thinking about functions, functions should only ever accomplish one thing and one thing only. If a function is supposed accomplish a task then that function should only accomplish that one task. That task should also be simple.
