## Even and Odds

Allow a user to put in a number `n`.

- Build a function called `get_evens()` and from that function return `n` number of even integers.
- Build a function called `get_odds()` and from that function return `n` number of odd integers.

BONUS: Build a function called `even_odd_handler()` that accepts a parameter `is_even` which is true or false. When true, it should call `get_evens()` and when false it should call `get_odds()`.
