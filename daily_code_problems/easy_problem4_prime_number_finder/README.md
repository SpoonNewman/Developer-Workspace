## What is Prime Number?
A positive natural number greater than 1, which only divisible by itself and 1 is known as a prime number. 

For example, 23 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and itself whereas 24 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 1,2,3,4,6,8,12 and itself.

Your objective is to write a python program to check whether a number is a prime number or not (true or false).

BONUS: If the number is not a prime number then print out what numbers the number can be divided by example: 24 is not a prime number because it is divisible by (print these: 1,2,3,4,6,8,12) and itself


# Get the input from user
# Take that input and check if it is a prime number
# If it is a prime number print it out 
# If it isn't a prime number print out what the number can be divided by
