You approach a book case in front of you and begin investigating the books resting in the book case. You run your finger over every book wiggling them around as you go until you land on a book that doesnt move left to right. You grab the top of the book and begin pulling it towards you. There is a slight grinding noise as metal scrapes agaisnt metal. You hear a loud click and the book case begins to shift. The book case grinds against rails attatched to the wall behind it. Revealing a hole barely large enough for you to fit through. In front of you is the opening to a small crawl space barely wide enough for you to lay on your stomach and crawl through. You hear faint echos of noises from the other end of the tunnel. #Player inputs some input# 

#Move Forward input: You begin to struggle to crawl through the crawl space. The noises slowly grow louder and more decipherable as you move foward. You hear what sounds like two beings talking to eachother. You can't make out their words but they sound angry #Player inputs some action#

#Continue foward action input: You can see the opening at the end of this tunnel. Two short beings are inside and are walking around carrying what looks like boxes of weapons
